/**
 * Locate the rendered-site root for an artifact that lives inside a Quarto
 * (or Quarto-like) multi-file output tree.
 *
 * A page such as `_build/aihydro/labs/03-unit-hydrograph-convolution.html`
 * references sibling-of-parent assets (`../site_libs/bootstrap/…`). For those
 * URLs to be servable by the webview, the *site root* (`_build/aihydro/`)
 * must be present in `localResourceRoots`, not just the page's own directory.
 *
 * Security bound: rooting an ancestor directory widens what any preview
 * iframe can fetch, so the walk is deliberately conservative:
 *   • at most MAX_WALK_UP levels above the artifact's directory;
 *   • a directory qualifies only with BOTH markers of a rendered Quarto site:
 *     a `site_libs/` child directory AND a `search.json` file (every rendered
 *     profile emits both; a coincidentally named `site_libs` alone does not
 *     qualify);
 *   • the first (deepest) qualifying directory wins.
 *
 * Callers must log the added root for auditability.
